<h1>The Duplicates Scanner</h1>
<p>
  Even tho Pinterest does tell you wether a pin is already on one of your boards, duplicates could still happen.<br/>
  For instance when images get pinned two times, two users pinning the same image, creating two seperate pins.
</p>
<p>
  The Duplicates Scanner can be found via the main menu under <span class="bold">Duplicates -&gt; Open Duplicates Scanner</span>.
  The dialog can be closed at any time by clicking the <span class="bold">I'm Done</span> button at the lower right or
  the close button of the dialog.
</p>

<h2>Setting Scanner Options</h2>
<p>
  The scanner has two settings, which will influence how duplicate images will get scanned.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">Similarity</span>
    <p>
      The slider, in the lower left of the scanner dialog, controls the sensitivity of the scanner.<br/>
      Higher values will make the scanner more sensitive, resulting in a less strict comparison.<br/>
      Lower values will make the scanner more restrictive, making the scanner pay more attention to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the best results it's best to run the scanner multiple times adjusting the slider to make the results more
      reliable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">Multithreaded Scanning</span>
    <p>
      By default the scanner will process multiple images at the same time, depending on the cores available on your
      machine. This greatly improves the scanner's speed, but also puts more load on your machine.
    </p>
    <p>Turn this setting off if you are experiencing performance issues when using the scanner.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Scan Results</h2>
<p>
  Pressing <span class="bold">Start Scan</span> will start scanning each board directory for duplicate images.<br/>
  You can stop this process at any time by pressing <span class="bold">Stop Scan</span>. Note that the scanner will
  finish the current board before aborting.<br/>
  Closing the scanner dialog will also stop the scanner.
</p>
<p>
  During the scan filenames will start to appear in the left pane.<br/>
  These filenames are images of which duplicates have been found.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  You can click on a filename in the left pane to view it's duplicates.<br/>
  On the right a list of previews will appear. The first item is the image with the best quality. Any items below the
  first item are duplicates or similar to the first item.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  You can select items you want to delete in the right pane by clicking on said item. Hold the CTRL key or SHIFT key and
  click items to
  select multiple.<br/>
  After selecting the items you want to delete click <span class="bold">Delete Selected</span> to delete the selected
  items.<br/>
  <span class="bold">Warning: Deleting ALL items in the above list will also delete the original file!</span>
